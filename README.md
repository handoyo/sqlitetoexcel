# sqlitetoexcel

Android Only

This plugin helps you export SqLite tables to Excel (.xls format only). 

There are three types of export:
1. Export All Tables.
2. Export Specific Tables.
3. Export Single Table.

You also can exclude columns from being exported into excel and prettify the column name.
